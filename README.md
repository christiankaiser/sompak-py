# sompak-py

Thin Python wrapper around SOM_PAK binaries available from [http://www.cis.hut.fi/research/som_pak/](http://www.cis.hut.fi/research/som_pak/).

SOM_PAK is a program package written in C written by the SOM Programming Team of the Helsinki University of Technology, Laboratory of Computer and Information Science, implementing the Self-Organising Map algorithm.

This project contains a *very* simple Python wrapper around these binaries, which are supposed to be installed inside a `bin` directory of the sompak Python module. The binaries or their source code are not included in this package and must be downloaded separately from [http://www.cis.hut.fi/research/som_pak/](http://www.cis.hut.fi/research/som_pak/), compiled according to the instructions and included within this Python module.

This `sompak` Python wrapper is avaiable using the MIT license. The SOM_PAK has its [own license](http://www.cis.hut.fi/research/som_pak/README) which is valid for the binaries.
